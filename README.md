# songJS
A music client written to serve the needs of music listeners that are sick of online streaming subscriptions and just want to play thier own collection of music anytime, anywhere.
## Introduction
Ever wanted a lightweight music client that can sync your local files onto a server so that they can be accessed anytime, anywhere, and on any device? Your music files can also be shared with others, or combined into one huge repository of music. This way, a group of 4 friends can access all the saved music anytime by setting up the client on their desktop and streaming through their mobile/online.

## Development
To be made.
